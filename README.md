# CharacterRelationshipResearch
This is my Senior Capstone project at Arcadia University. This project is written entirely in Python, and analyzes data from books in text format. This data is then processed, and the resulting data is utilized in generating graphs to visualize the interactions between characters in books, per book.

**ABSOLUTE NONE** of this code is organized! Every single Python file that has been written for this project was compiled into one repo, and uploaded here. I will upload the organized version at a later date.
